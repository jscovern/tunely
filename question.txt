need to somehow switch the order of the callbacks, so that the final rendering/function call doesn't happen until we have the results from the server yet.  Does it make sense to do the .get call (and switch that to a .ajax with a type of "GET", and a success: callback), and have the callback be something later down the line towards rendering the html (to essentially set up a chain that they must go in)?
